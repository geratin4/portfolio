                <p>I create digital projects that can be used by people to interact with devices.

                    <p>we made a paper prototype of Unicooks, 
                        We added the features and layout that we wanted to use on our website so users can interact with it. 
                        We let our class mate interest with the paper prototype and gave them explanation on our ideas and we asked them on their feedback on how they found it and any improvements/changes we can make.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I learned from this that prototypes are very important in the process of making a website.
                         It is easier to show case the idea to the user/stake holder and they can also interact with it which give them an idea on what the website would be.
                          in the mario & Luigi project, we did not really focus on a paper prototype or even showcasing it to users, to give their feed back.</p>
