                    In Mario and Luigi Pizzeria, I believe I didn't acquire significant experience or knowledge in digital design.
                     However, with UniCooked, I did manage to gain some valuable experience and knowledge in the field of digital design. </p>
                <br>
                <p> In Mario and Luigi Pizzeria, we didn't engage in any research on design; instead, we proceeded directly to creating a web page in HTML following a paper-based design. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In UniCooked, we conducted some research on website design, exploring color schemes and strategies to fit our website to our target audience.
                     Additionally, we experimented with various paper prototypes design concepts, encouraging student interaction to gather feedback that informed our final design decisions.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>Observing the distinct outcomes of Mario and Luigi Pizzeria compared to UniCooked taught me the significance of the design process. 
                    In the former project, where design was not prioritized, the result lacked visual appeal,
                     highlighting the importance of investing time in the design phase, as evidenced by the more visually pleasing outcome in UniCooked, where emphasis was placed on the design process.
