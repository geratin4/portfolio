                    <br>
                    <p>Mario and Luigi Pizzeria faced challenges due to the absence of modern systems for order management, leading to a chaotic workflow. To address this issue as a group project, we aimed to develop a solution. Our goal was to create a user-friendly ordering system for customers. Additionally, we aimed to integrate this order system with the kitchen system, incorporating a smart oven for more efficient operations.</p>

                    resulting in the accidental deletion of over 30 files in the group project. Recognizing the mistake, 
                    I took responsibility for the error and worked promptly to fix the problem.</p>
