                    <p>As a team, we wanted to help students with their common problems. 
                        We noticed that many struggle with cooking, 
                        so we decided to create a simple solution called Unicooked.</p>

                    <p>In this project, my responsibility was focused on the front end. 
                        Specifically, I took charge of designing the equipment page, 
                        curating budget-friendly recipes, and creating the layout for presenting the recipes.</p>

                 we also developed a project plan with defined deliverables for Unicooked.
                  I believe this approach significantly contributed to keeping us on track and setting clear goals for the pace at which we wanted to advance our website.</p>

                         We created a paper prototype for them to interact with. Based on the received feedback, we incorporated necessary adjustments into our design.</p>

                         When developing the design and layout, as well as determining the essential recipe categories,
                          we kept the needs and preferences of students in mind. This user-focus approach aimed to create a platform that is particularly well-suited and appealing to the student demographic. </p>
